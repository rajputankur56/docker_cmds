Step 1 : clone git repo
git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/node-bulletin-board
cd node-bulletin-board/bulletin-board-app

Step 2 : define docker file
File availabel in node_bulletin-board

Step 3 : build and test image
docker build --tag bulletinboard:1.0 .

Step 4 : Run image as a container
docker run --publish 8000:8080 --detach --name bb bulletinboard:1.0

There are a couple of common flags here:

--publish asks Docker to forward traffic incoming on the host’s port 8000 to the container’s port 8080. Containers have their own private set of ports, so if you want to reach one from the network, you have to forward traffic to it in this way. Otherwise, firewall rules will prevent all network traffic from reaching your container, as a default security posture.
--detach asks Docker to run this container in the background.
--name specifies a name with which you can refer to your container in subsequent commands, in this case bb.


Step 5 : 
Visit your application in a browser at localhost:8000

Step 6 : optional, incase you want to delete image
docker rm --force bb
